# Data_cleaning-
In this project, I performed comprehensive data cleaning using SQL to prepare raw data for accurate analysis and reporting. The dataset initially contained inconsistencies, duplicate records, and missing values that could impact data quality. 

Key steps included:
Removing duplicates by identifying repeated records and retaining only unique entries to ensure data integrity

Standardizing data by formatting text fields, dates, and categorical values to maintain consistency across the dataset

Handling null and blank values by identifying missing data and applying appropriate fixes such as updating, replacing, or filtering records based on business logic

Deleting unnecessary columns to eliminate redundant or irrelevant information and optimize the dataset for analysis

As a result, the cleaned dataset became more reliable, structured, and ready for downstream analysis, visualization, and decision-making.
